## Day 1: The Encounter

Sunday, June 23rd, 2002 - Santa Barbara, California

It *started out* as a nice day... Jayne and I were
supposed to meet some friends at the beach for a walk, but we
were afraid of getting too much sun - since we spent all day
Saturday celebrating Solstice outside.

Instead, we headed up shady *Rattlesnake*
canyon (seriously, that's the name of the canyon), walking up the
creek in our sandals. I stopped to take this nice picture of a
small waterfall.

Little did I know that within minutes of taking that picture, a
rattlesnake (**Crotalus viridus**) would strike at my
leg as I walked towards that very fall.
