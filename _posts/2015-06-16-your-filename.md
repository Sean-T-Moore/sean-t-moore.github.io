## Day 1: The Encounter

Sunday, June 23rd, 2002 - Santa Barbara, California

It *started out* as a nice day... My girlfriend and I were
supposed to meet some friends at the beach for a walk, but we
were afraid of getting too much sun - since we spent all day
Saturday celebrating Summer Solstice outside.

Instead, we headed up shady *Rattlesnake*
canyon (seriously, that's the name of the canyon), walking up the
creek in our sandals. I stopped to take this nice picture of a
small waterfall.

Little did I know that within minutes of taking that picture, a
rattlesnake (**Crotalus viridus**) would strike at my
leg as I walked towards that very fall.

I never saw it coming. It was not a pleasant experience - more mentally disturbing than physically painful. We're all told to avoid rattlers, but how bad would a bite really be? I've never talked to anyone who had been bitten before. Could I die? Could I lose my leg? I tried to sit down and collect my wits, but that darn rattler started coming towards us - I don't know what it was thinking - it really wanted to protect it's waterfall! Once I stood up, it backed off into a crevice under a nearby rock.

We weren't very far from our vehicle, but it would be treacherous to return the way we came, hopping river rocks with an injured leg. Instead, we decided to cut over to an access road that parallels the creek, but that meant climbing out of the river drainage and pumping a lot of venom through my system quickly. Once we climbed to the top of an old debris dam, I was feeling pronounced neurological abnormalities in my tongue and lips. The site of the bite had swollen and continued to ooze blood. I hobbled down the road to where our vehicle was parked. Very unfortunately, a locked gate separated us from the vehicle - only 20 ft to go and here was this locked gate! I wasn't going to be able to climb it very easily so we found a way to crawl under. Of course, this meant putting the bite above my heart - which I seemed to recall was a bad idea - but I figured we would be at the hospital soon enough. 

We got to the hospital within 30 minutes of the bite incident, but it would be almost 2 hours before the antivenin was ready. I was dizzy and on the verge of passing out as they asked all those pesky questions like "do you have insurance", "what is your phone number", "where do you work"...? I finally got a room and they hooked me up to all sorts of monitors: blood pressure, blood oxygen, and EKG. They started a saline and antibiotic IV to flush out the poison and keep me hydrated. A tetanus booster was also given.

One of the many nasty effects of snake venom is that it initially prevents blood from clotting. This picture of the wound was taken 1.5 hours after the bite and continued to ooze for several hours more. The bite is about halfway between my left ankle and calf on the outside of my leg. I was told I had to wait for the antivenin to be reconstituted, and unfortunately there were only 4 vials available in the city. According to the manufacturer, 10-12 vials are recommended for treatment over a course of 18 hours.

During this time in the ER, the muscles in my leg near the bite began to twitch involuntarily. Once the antivenin was administered, I began to feel better and more alert. The numbness and tingling in my mouth diminished, but would continue for a couple more days.

I was moved to the Intensive Care Unit for observation overnight. I slept not one wink. They measured my leg hourly for signs of expansion and compartment syndrome, but nothing more happened to my leg that night - it did not even hurt very badly. I was disturbed more by the automatic blood pressure cuff expanding around my arm every 15 minutes.

## Day 2: Panic

I was released from the hospital. I wanted to go home. Sure, it hurt when I tried to stand up, but I figured I just needed some rest and I wasn't going to get that in the hospital. The doctors seemed to agree. Little did I know at the time that I would not be walking again for a LONG time. Once I got home, my foot begun to swell and my leg around the bite was changing hue - to a very deep purple. And boy did it hurt. The strange sensations in my mouth were again getting stronger. I called the Doctor and he told us to wait a few hours and see if it got better. It did not. We returned to the ER, but it was completely full, with no rooms available. I was hoping to get more antivenin - clearly, more poison was lurking about. Finally the Doc visited me in the waiting room, wrapped the leg to help the swelling and sent me away. I don't know if more antivenin would have made a difference or not. Later, I found out from a friend that [antivenin is in very short supply](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Snakebite-antivenin-in-short-supply-in-U-S-2827045.php) this summer - another good reason to be especially careful hiking - you might not be able to get proper treatment if you are bitten.

## Day 3: More Panic

I can not sit up - the pain is unbearable if I try. I certainly can not stand. Some tissue near the bite has not only turned deep purple, but has hardened considerably. Snake venom is highly complex and can cause tissue necrosis. I was certainly experiencing hemorrhaging of all the capillaries in the lower part of my leg, and some minor bleeding as high as my inner thigh.
